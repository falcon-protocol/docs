## What are Perks?
Perks are a membership benefit that can be offered to your subscribers. They are available to subscribers of supported subscription apps and can be used to drive additional revenue and retention.

## Who is offering Perks?
Any subscription business can offer Perks. Whether you sell physical or digital products or goods in your subscriptions, you can take advantage of Perks as a value add to your subscription offering.

## Values of Perks
There are two primary value propositions for Perks:

1. Distribution - Through the Falcon Perks network you are able to massively increase the distribution of your application or subscription service, through partners Perks programs. Bringing your offering to a wider audience of exclusively qualified subscribed users. 

2. LTV Increase - Most Subscription businesses are 'hard capped' on their lifetime value. If a subscriber is on your highest annual plan which has unlocked all features, typically there are no ways to up-sell this customer and you are capped on LTV. A Perk program allows you to unlock this LTV cap through offering your subscribers a limitless amount of additional benefits they can take advantage of which brings your business more revenue for every Perk they take advantage of.
