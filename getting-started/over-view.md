## What is an app bundle
An app bundle is a collection of two or more subscription apps that are distributed together in a single discounted purchaseable package to the end consumer.

## Who is app bundling for
App bundling is for any subscription business; whether you sell physical or
digitial products or goods in your subscriptions you can take advantage of app
bundling.

## Values of app bundling
There are two primary value propositions for app bundling:

1. Distribution - By bundling your subscription service with others you can
   increase your reach and distribution. Any app that is part of the bundling
   protocol becomes a potential distribution channel for your app.

2. Monetization - By bundling other subscription apps with your offering, you
   can increase the value of your subscription service and increase subscription
   conversion rates as well as customer lifetime value.

## Goal of the Falcon protocol
Until now the prospect of app bundling for subscription business was in almost
all cases unfeasible. 

There are many technical and commercial elements to create an app bundle, each
with their own challenges that reduce the liklihood of success. 

The goal of the Falcon protocol is to provide a universal standard infrastructure that will allow all market participants to easily create and distribute app bundles.

The primary features of the Falcon protocol are:
1. Entitlement management - Managing the access rights of the end consumer during
   the lifecycle of an app bundle.
2. Reselling escrow - Programmatic money acceptance from bundle publishers that
   are optionally, in the case of super bundles, collecting revenues on behalf
   of merchants. Falcon then handles remittance of this revenue to the various
   merchants.
3. Commissions remittance - Facilitating tracking & comission payments from merchants to bundle
   publisher for successful user acquisition baased on the programmed contract terms. 
4. Partner discovery & business development - A mechanism for businesses to
   discover and partner together to form bundles.
