## What is an app bundle
An app bundle is a collection of one or more subscription apps that are distributed together in a single purchaseable package to the end consumer.

## Who is app bundling for
App bundling is for any subscription business; whether you sell physical or
digitial products or goods in your subscriptions you can take advantage of app
bundling.

## Values of app bundling
There are two primary value propositions for app bundling:

1. Distribution - By bundling your subscription service with others you can
   increase your reach and distribution. Any app that is part of the bundling
   protocol becomes a potential distribution channel for your app.

2. Monetization - By bundling other subscription apps with your offering, you
   can increase the value of your subscription service and increase subscription
   conversion rates as well as customer lifetime value.

## Goal of the Falcon protocol
Until now the prospect of app bundling for subscription business was in almost
all cases unfeasible. 

There are many technical and commercial elements to create an app bundle, each
with their own challenges that reduce the liklihood of success. 

The goal of the Falcon protocol is to provide a universal standard infrastructure that will allow all market participants to easily create and distribute app bundles.

The primary features of the Falcon protocol are:
1. Entitlement management - Managing the access rights of the end user during
   the lifecycle of an app bundle.
2. Smart Escrow - Programmatic money remittance for apps that are to receive
   revenue from the 'collector' in a bundle as well as commission remittance for
   apps that are to receive a commission for driving sales to an app in the
   bundle.
3. Partner discovery - A mechanism for apps to discover other apps to bundle
   with
