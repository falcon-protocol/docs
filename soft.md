## What is a soft bundle
A soft bundle is where a customer is offered a bundle deal of two or more
applications but payment for these applications is handled by each bundle
participant independently. Typically the merchant apps in the bundle (those
being sold by the reseller) will offer the user a discount or deal on a
subscription in their own app which is exclusive to the bundle reseller.

### Lifecycle sequence
- Merchant apps in the bundle define special deal pricing only available to the
  resller
- The reseller merchandises this special pricing as part of a subscription
  bundle in their app. The customer will only receive this special pricing after
  subscribing to the resllers apps.
- Upon subscription the customer is granted deal access to the merchant app and
  is directed to authenticate with the merchant app and receive their discounted
  plan.
